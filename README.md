### Bio:

Hi there, I'm Parsa KamaliPour. My major is Computer Software Engineering, and in addition to that, I am also a self-taught game developer, My friend and I have formed an Indie Game Development Team, It's called "Null References"; we're working on a game called "Uncertainty"; Uncertainty is an action-adventure space-shooter game, built with Unity.

I am interested in Algorithms, Problem-solving, Software Engineering, and Programming.

Since I like Sciences, and I am particularly fascinated by theoretical Computer Science, I am striving to make an outstanding resume in order to apply for a Ph.D. at a great University in the future.
