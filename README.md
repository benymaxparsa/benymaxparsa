### Bio:

Thanks for stopping by. I'm Parsa KamaliPour. In addition to majoring in Software Engineering, I am also a self-taught game developer, My friend and I have formed an Indie Game Development Team, It's called "Null References"; we're working on a game called "Uncertainty"; Uncertainty is an action-adventure space-shooter game, built with Unity.

Besides algorithms, I have a great interest in programming, problem-solving, software engineering, and game development.  

In light of my interest in Sciences, and especially theoretical Computer Science, I am striving to make an outstanding resume in order to one day apply to a Ph.D. program at a prestigious University.
