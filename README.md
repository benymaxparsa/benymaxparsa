### Bio:

Hi there, I'm Parsa KamaliPour. I'm a Computer Software Engineering Student, and also I happen to be an Indie Game developer, as a matter of fact, I have Co-Founded an Indie Game development Team with my friend, It's called "Null References"; We are working on a game called "Uncertainty"; It's a multiplayer game about spaceship battles, oh, and It's a 3D game, made with Unity and Mirror.

I'm interested in Algorithms, Problem-solving, Software engineering, and Programming.

I like learning Sciences, and I'm crazy about theoretical Computer Science, thus I'm trying hard to make an impressive resume for myself in order to apply for a Ph.D. at a great University in the future.
